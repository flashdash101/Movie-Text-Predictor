# Movie-Text-Predictor
A simple Text Predictor which uses RNNs to predict the next word of the input

## Description
Developed a Text Predictor Application using deep learning, trained on 5,000 movie titles with a 68% prediction accuracy. Collaborated for optimization, created user-friendly GUI, showcasing NLP and deep learning application in sequence modeling.

## pre-requisite requirements:
Install the following modules: Pandas, tensorflow, tkinter, numpy ,fuzzywuzzy ,Levenshtein (optional), functools and threading using pip install [ModuleName]

## Issues
* Before you finished typing a prediction is to be made (sometimes incorrect), can be alleviated with pressing anything on the keyboard
* Sometimes produces the wrong prediction e.g. 'Spiderman' returns 'Superman', But 'Spider-Man' or 'Spider Ma' works fine

## Future Ideas
* Expand onto a bigger dataset and different dataset when i get a more powerful setup.
* Explore ideas such as pressing Tab to auto complete the suggestion. (The suggestion will be in grey and the user can be press tab to autocomplete)
